Hello, nice to meet you! I’m @carguygrammer
I’m fascinated with technology, there's so much that can be done with a bit of imagination. I love exploring new programming skills, I have a love for cars, working on them and customizing, and anything that has to do with creating and bringing ideas to life.

I’m currently taking "the Web Developement bootcamp 2021" course at Udemy and will eventually persue a computer science degree.
I’m looking to learn and take part of projects and ultimately to succeed as a web developer.

If you like to reach out to me my email is, adrian.le1995@gmail.com
